    I’ve been replaying everything in my head. I now realize how much I hurt you — with my actions, my words, or even my silence. You never deserved that. You deserve love, kindness, patience — and I failed to give you that. 💔<br><br>
    Please know it wasn’t intentional, but I understand that doesn’t make it okay. I’ve taken this to heart, and I promise to change and be better. You matter. A lot. 🥺
